Project Title
Global SaaS Platform: Secure, Scalable Infrastructure with Terraform
Objective: Build a production-grade SaaS infrastructure supporting 10K+ users with multi-region deployment, automated CI/CD, and enterprise security

Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation
1.1 Remote State Management
Requirements:

Versioned S3 bucket with AES-256 encryption

DynamoDB table for state locking

IAM policy restricting state access

Implementation Steps:

Create unique S3 bucket name with random_id

Configure bucket versioning and server-side encryption

Create DynamoDB table with LockID primary key

Set up S3 backend in backend.hcl

Test state locking with concurrent applies

1.2 Global VPC Architecture
Diagram
Code









Implementation Steps:

Create VPC module with variables for CIDR blocks

Use count to deploy identical VPCs in 2 regions

Calculate subnets with cidrsubnet() function

Create NAT gateways with EIPs in public subnets

Set up VPC peering with routing tables

Phase 2: Compute Layer
2.1 Auto-Scaling Web Tier
Requirements:

Min 3 / Max 12 EC2 instances per region

Zero-downtime rolling deployments

Custom AMI with pre-baked dependencies

Implementation Steps:

Create launch template with user_data bootstrap script

Configure ASG with lifecycle hooks

Set up CloudWatch metrics for scaling policies

Use for_each for multiple target groups

Implement health checks with grace period

2.2 Serverless Processing
Diagram
Code





Implementation Steps:

Create Lambda functions with IAM execution roles

Configure SQS with dead-letter queue

Set up API Gateway with Terraform aws_apigatewayv2

Use archive_file for Lambda deployment packages

Phase 3: Data Layer
3.1 Multi-Region Databases
Components:

RDS MySQL with read replica in DR region

DynamoDB global tables with 2 replicas

S3 bucket for backups with lifecycle rules

Implementation Steps:

Create parameter groups with custom configurations

Configure RDS with multi-AZ and backup retention

Set up DynamoDB with autoscaling

Implement point-in-time recovery

Create IAM roles for backup/restore

3.2 Secrets Management
Implementation Steps:

Store DB credentials in Secrets Manager

Create KMS key with rotation policy

Use data source to fetch secrets at runtime:

hcl
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db" {
  secret_id = "prod/db/credentials"
}
Grant IAM roles least privilege access

Phase 4: Security & Compliance
4.1 Defense-in-Depth
Diagram
Code





Implementation Steps:

Create WAF rules: SQLi, XSS, rate limiting

Configure security groups with dynamic ingress:

hcl
dynamic "ingress" {
  for_each = var.api_ports
  content {
    from_port   = ingress.value
    to_port     = ingress.value
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [var.vpc_cidr]
  }
}
Enable VPC flow logs to S3

Set up AWS Config rules for compliance

Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline
5.1 GitOps Deployment Workflow
Diagram
Code






Implementation Steps:

Create CodeBuild project for Terraform

Configure pipeline stages with manual approval

Implement workspace strategy:

hcl
environment = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "production" : "development"
Add automated security scanning (tfsec, checkov)

Set up notifications for apply events

Phase 6: Monitoring & Optimization
6.1 Observability Stack
Components:

CloudWatch dashboards

X-Ray service maps

Cost anomaly detection

SLO tracking

Implementation Steps:

Create CloudWatch metric filters

Configure alarms with SNS notifications

Use for_each to create resource tagging policy

Set up Budgets with Terraform

Implement VPC traffic mirroring
